絶対ケガするからやめておこう。
何かロープのようなものがあれば・・・","No, it's way too high up.

ロープはフックショットを作るのに使ってしまった・・・
フックショットでは長さが足りない・・・","No good...
You already used the rope to make a hookshot...

"サンタ",
"\n<サンタ>やぁこんにちは。
ボク、白猫のサンタ。
人間がここに居るなんて珍しいね。","\n<Santa>Good afternoon.
I'm Santa, the white cat.
It's unusual to see a human around here."
"\n<サンタ>なんで驚いてんの？
猫だって喋るさ。","\n<Santa>Why are you so surprised?
Cats can talk too."
"\n<サンタ>ところでアーコ知らない？
帰りが遅いから心配して見に来たんだけど、
どこも閉め切ってて入れなくてさ。","\n<Santa>By the way, do you know Ako?
She was late coming home, so I got worried and
came to check on her. I found all the exits sealed off."
"\n<サンタ>脱出ゲームかぁ。
それで閉じ込められてたんだ。
なんだか大変そうだね。","\n<Santa>Escape game, hmm.
So you're both locked in here.
That's a bit of a problem."
"\n<サンタ>・・・そういえば。
さっきそこの下で鍵拾ったからあげる。
何の鍵か分からないけど。","\n<Santa>...That reminds me.
I picked up a key down there a little while ago.
I don't know what it's for."
"\n<サンタ>じゃ、脱出頑張ってね。
無事なら別に会わなくていいや。
アーコによろしく言っておいてー。","\n<Santa>Well, best of luck escaping.
If you manage to get out safe, don't wait up for me.
Please give Ako my regards."
"\n<サンタ>あ、逃げたいからって、
ここから飛び降りるのはやめておいた方がいいよ。
ボクは猫だから平気だけど、キミはちゃんとカルシウム取ってる？","\n<Santa>Ah, since you're trying to escape, I wouldn't advise
jumping from here. I'm a cat, so I have no problem, but...
Well... How is your calcium intake?"
"EV008",
"フタのようだ・・・
重くて開かない。","Some kind of grate... It's too heavy to open."
